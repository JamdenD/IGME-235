        <blockquote>
            "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time should be recommended playing 
            for ever aspiring videogame designer and programmer out there. If you're
             making games and you haven't played this game, then you're like a director
              who has never seen Citizen Kane or a musician who has never heard of Mozart." -IGN
