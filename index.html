        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p> Hello! My name is Camden! I am a second year Game Design and Development student and 
            I am getting a minor in Software Engineering and Psychology. I am interested in making art, baking
            making music (mainly singing and guitar for now), and playing videogames. I hope to learn as much
            as I can in life. I love learning new skills and the feeling of getting better and being
            good at something. When I graduate, I want to be confident in my skills.
        </p>
